I work on probability theory at the interface of stochastic processes and machine learning, aiming to build rigorous, quantitative laws for **discrete-time stochastic algorithms** beyond diffusion approximations.

## Themes
- **Stochastic recurrence / exit times:** rigorous finite-time and rare-event behavior for discrete stochastic dynamics motivated by SGD-like updates.
- **Metastability & Edge of Stability:** understanding stability thresholds and large excursions that drive regime switches during training.
- **Anisotropic noise & generalization:** linking directional noise, landscape geometry, and algorithmic notions of flatness (e.g., via escape times or stability margins).

## Previous Projects
- **Exit-time theory for Kesten’s stochastic recurrence equations:** scaling laws for mean exit times and their connection to heavy-tailed stationary behavior.

## Current Projects
- **CFR+ convergence rates:** asymptotic rates for Counterfactual Regret Minimization+ in imperfect-information games (Poker), with provable exponents in simple benchmark games.
- A metastability-based theory for EoS driven by rare events and non-Gaussian effects.
- Trajectory-aware, data-dependent generalization theory grounded in the regions actually visited by training.
